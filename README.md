## Build

Install the vulkan sdk on the official website and enable everything except for Volk if you don't want it, then just compile with cmake.

every other dependency has it's folder named, just install from their specific github repo to there.
### YOU CAN TRY IS NOT THAT EASY, I'M WORKING ON IT.

## Platform
WINDOWS

I'm currently trying to run it on linux (it wasn't as easy as I tought either...).
